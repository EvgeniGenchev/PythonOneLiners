# PythonOneLiners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been astonished by the programmers who give one line Python solution to a problem I write 30 lines C or Java code to. 
Originally that is what made me start learning Python. So now after having some expeience programming in Python I want to share some of these one liners.
I update the list almost every day.
